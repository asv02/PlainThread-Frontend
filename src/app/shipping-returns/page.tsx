        <h2>Delivery</h2>
        <p>
          Website orders are shipped with Delhivery. Transit time depends on your
          PIN code. You will get tracking once the shipment is handed over.
        </p>

        <h2>Returns after delivery</h2>
        <p>
          If the tee does not work for you after Delhivery marks it delivered,
          you may request a return within <strong>7 days of the delivered date</strong>.
          The garment must be unused, unwashed, and in original condition with
          tags attached.
        </p>
        <p>
          Marketplace orders (Amazon or Flipkart) follow that marketplace&apos;s
          return rules, not this page.
        </p>

        <h2>How a return is collected</h2>
        <p>
          Reverse pickup is arranged through our logistics partner,{" "}
          <strong>iThink Logistics</strong>. Email{" "}
          <a href={`mailto:${siteConfig.email}?subject=Return%20request`}>
            {siteConfig.email}
          </a>{" "}
          with your order ID, delivered date, and reason. We will schedule a
          pickup at the delivery address. Do not ship the parcel back on your
          own unless we ask you to.
        </p>

        <h2>Refunds</h2>
        <p>
          After the return is picked up and inspected, prepaid orders are refunded
          to the original Razorpay method (admin marks the payment refunded). COD
          orders were never collected online, so there is no Razorpay refund — stock
          is returned when the parcel is marked returned. Pickup is not a refund by
          itself.
        </p>

        <h2>Cancellations before dispatch</h2>
        <p>
          You can cancel from your order link while the parcel is still pending,
          including COD. Closing Magic Checkout does not cancel a completed prepaid
          charge or a placed COD order. Once it is shipped with Delhivery, use this
          return policy after delivery instead.
